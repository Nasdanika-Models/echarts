# ECharts
Ecore models representing data structures for different types of Apache ECharts. 
Implemented on top of [ECharts Java](https://github.com/ECharts-Java/ECharts-Java). 
The goal is to provide a higher level of abstraction for building graphs. 
In particular, the model uses object references for node to category and links to source and target. 
Links are implemented as contained objects of source nodes.
